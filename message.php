                I feel ecstatic to cordially welcome you all in 6th International conference on Recent Advances in Mathematical Sciences and its Applications (RAMSA - 2022).

                This year we have planned this conference in hybrid mode as the prevailing epidemic has subsided but not vanished completely. I hope this conference will provide a memorable and remarkable platform to disseminate ideas of current research trends in mathematics and related disciplines.

                We hope that during your time at the conference, you'll be successful in learning about new research in your field while enjoying our warm hospitality. We look forward to meeting you in RAMSA-2022.
            </p>
