                    Mathematics plays a key role in the development of modern sciences, engineering, management and many other important areas of activities. With this aim in mind the Department of Mathematics was established from the very inception with a Vision to attain excellence in teaching and research and become a leader in the field of mathematics and its applications. Besides catering to the basic needs of the various B. Tech., M. Tech. and Ph. D. programs of the Institute, it had a strong fervor towards research and development. The Department has a good blend of pure and applied mathematicians, which provides a vibrant research atmosphere. The specializations of the faculty members cover most of the important and emerging areas of Mathematics. The Department is also actively involved in its own research and development activities through its B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. Programs.

                    The aim of this conference is to bring together learned mathematicians, scientists, engineers, researchers from industry and research scholars working in the different areas of mathematics at a common platform. The Conference provides an excellent opportunity to researchers, practitioners and educators to present and discuss the recent innovations in mathematics for potential implementation in sciences and engineering. It focuses on strengthening the existing results along with identifying the practical challenges encountered with respect to various solutions adopted in the fields of Mathematics and its Applications. Moreover, it will provide an opportunity to enhance collaboration among researchers not only from the various parts of the country but also with those from abroad. The scientific program will consist of Keynote/plenary/invited lectures and parallel sessions for contributed presentations. The main emphasis will be on the vibrant implicational aspects of applied mathematics for cultivating contemporary and advanced findings in multidimensional sphere of engineering and sciences. The invited lectures and refereed contributed papers will be published in the proceedings after due reviewing process by the committee of experts in various disciplines. The conference proceedings of the previous series of RAMSA were published by <b> AIP (Scopus Indexed), USA and Nova Publishers, USA.</b>
